# project_x
A super awesome text-based game.


# Instructions
- Updated to a new boiler plate. I use Yarn for quick install
- Just clone this and do `npm install` then `npm start` then go to `http://localhost:8080/`
- If you want to use Yarn do `npm install -g yarn` then `yarn install` then `yarn start`
- For more yarn commands visit https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/migrating-from-npm/
